3. Include a clear description, reproduction steps, affected versions, and any PoC code if available.
4. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a timeline for fixes.

Please do NOT include any sensitive data when reporting publicly.

Disclosure timeline

- We aim to provide a fix and security advisory within 30 days for severities classified as high/critical.
- For coordination and responsible disclosure, we reserve the right to extend the timeline in case of complex fixes.

Credit

We will credit reporters who agree to be acknowledged in the release notes, unless they request anonymity.
