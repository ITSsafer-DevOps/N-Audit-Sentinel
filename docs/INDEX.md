## Documentation Index

This `docs/` index collects the canonical enterprise-level documentation for the N-Audit Sentinel project.

- `README.md` — Project overview, architecture, and quick start (canonical top-level README).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution and development workflow.
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` — Results of a repository-level security scan.
- `ENTERPRISE_LEVEL_AUDIT.md` — Enterprise audit artifacts and checklists.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — Deployment guidance and token usage.
- `FINALIZATION_REPORT.md` — Finalization summary and release manifest (generated at the end of the pipeline).

Notes:

- Some legacy documents remain at the repository root for backwards compatibility; the docs index points to canonical files to review first.
