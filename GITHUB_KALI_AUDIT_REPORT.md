## 5) KALI LINUX READINESS

Status: ✅ READY FOR SUBMISSION

All mandatory compliance checks passed for a Kali packaging submission. The repository contains production-ready code (v1.0.0-Beta), documentation, tests and CI. There are no tracked secrets and no prohibited tracked artifacts.

### Recommendations (minor)

- Consider adding `TOOLS.md` to document internal utilities in more detail (optional).  
- Ensure the `backups/` archives remain untracked; if you need to distribute artifacts, attach them to the GitHub Release rather than committing to the repo.  
- Optionally add a `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes file in the repo to make packaging review easier.

## 6) Next Steps

- Submit to `bugs.kali.org` or contact Kali maintainers with the release link: https://github.com/ITSsafer-DevOps/N-Audit-Sentinel/releases/tag/v1.0.0-Beta
- Provide maintainers with the binary/source checksums included in backups/BACKUP_LOG.txt
